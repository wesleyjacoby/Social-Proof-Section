## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I found this challenge very difficult. The hardest part was deciding whether to use CSS Grid or Flexbox and then how to implement it for the mobile and desktop versions.

CSS Grid would have been perfect for the mobile design, but I wsn't sure how to implement it for the desktop version.

I ended up using Flexbox for both the mobile and desktop version.

### Continued development

I definitely need to do more challenges like this and experiment with maybe using both CSS Grid and Flexbox.
